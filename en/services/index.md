**BUGS PROGRAM**
Mattias Turovski
125 â‚¬ / 45min

The program introduces four different animals, the giant snails, cockroaches, walkingsticks and millipedes. The presentation looks at their images, habitats and introduces ecology. Children can "see and touch" all of them. The program creates preconditions for independent exploration, communication and treatment with invertebrate animals, with respect and care.

Very special and exciting program!
