Torela is a new and exciting playroom in PÃµhja-Tallinn, between Kalamaja and Pelgulinna.

We are opening our doors on **May 1st**!

You can celebrate children birthdays, come play morning playtime and join us in theme-nights. From autumn children can take part of different hobby-classes.

The room is 185 m<sup>2</sup>.

Torela toys are child friendly and contribute to development. Children can use their creativity as well as strengthen their muscles. In the playroom kids can climb along the wall and ride around with cars. Kids can use a lot of their creativity by building balltracks on magnetwall, draw with chalk on chalkwall and mountains in the sandbox of augmented reality.

For babies we have a nice seperated corner and for nursing a private room. There is a kitchen with fridge, oven, stove, microwave and kettle in the room. Kitchen utensils includes: juice jug (3 pcs), salad bowls (3 pcs), trays (3 pcs), 2 knives, tart server (2 pcs), tablespoons, coffee cups (14 pcs), vases. We also provide sugar, coffee and tea.

14 adults and 14 children can sit comfortably around tables.
One party at a time in the playroom.
